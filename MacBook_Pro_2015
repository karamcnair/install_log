#MacBook Pro (2015)

##Reimage with El Capitan 
2016-02-06, 10:37 AM:
* Worked on fixing Mail issues. 
  * Deleted my primary account from all machines.
  * Recreated manually
  * Unchecked "Automatically detect and maintain account settings"
    * Mail was trying to login plain instead of MD5/CRAM until I checked "Allow insecure authentication". 
    * Unchecking it & restarting Mail seems to have fixed it, finally. Fingers crossed - that config has been screwed up for months.
    
 * Menu Bar: display Bluetooth, Displays, Battery %, AM/PM, Date, Day of Week, Keyboard/Character
 * Desktop: Bahamas Aerial
 * ScreenSaver: Ken Burns, NatGeo
